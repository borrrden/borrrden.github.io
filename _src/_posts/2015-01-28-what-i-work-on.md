For my first entry I would like to explain in my own words what it is exactly that I work on.  I work on a product named [Couchbase Lite](http://developer.couchbase.com/mobile/develop/guides/couchbase-lite/), which is a component of [Couchbase Mobile](http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/couchbase-mobile).  Couchbase Mobile is a solution that allows a developer to store data using the NoSQL paradigm locally on mobile devices, with an easy way to sync and replicate data to servers via something called [Sync Gateway](http://developer.couchbase.com/mobile/develop/guides/sync-gateway/).

The benefit to this is that the full persistence and replication stack is already taken care of for you.  You can view the sources of the various implementations (iOS, Android, .NET, etc) via the [Couchbase GitHub page](https://github.com/couchbase).  Specifically I am in charge of implementing the [.NET version](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-net).  Later I may write some articles exploring the internals of Couchbase Lite, so stay tuned!
